# The Glossist


## Mission Statement
We believe in spreading knowledge of policy and legal documents that are the foundation of our democracy. It’s at the heart of The Glossist's mission. It's a prerequisite for being informed citizens.

Put simply, informed citizens and democracy are tied together.

The policy and legal documents ecosystem digital repository should remain open, accessible and usable. We provide publishers, journalists and the public with a cutting-edge tool, technological infrastructure, and new formats to access and share policy and legal documents relevant for their community.

We are building a better future for news, policy making, and informed citizenry.

## Pain Points
Law determines the flow of wealth and punishment in a healthy democracy. And law provides the pivot point in moments of reform. Yet, there's no easy way of accessing and sharing the law, and so there’s no easy way for citizens to follow what’s directing their nation.

So, one way of putting what we're trying to do with The Glossist is to make the law accessible and easy to share, so that conversations can form around legislation, and an informed citizenry can take command of the country’s future. By providing the law itself, rather than punditry, users of The Glossist can trust they're encountering ground truth, concerning the actions of their leaders and the direction the country is headed.

Too often, public debate on a legislation revolves around a clash of confrontation of perceptions. How can one's perception be rebutted as unequivocally false? True, one can search through records of, say Congressional legisations on House.gov. What if concerned citizens, experts and journalists could directly go to the legislation being debated and higlight and share the relevant sections?

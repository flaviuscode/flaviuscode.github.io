My background includes independent journalism, conflict reporting, investigations, convening, and consulting on sustainable development.

One of my most exciting projects, [Data Journalism DC](https://www.meetup.com/data-journalism/), is bringing together data scientists, journalists, researchers, and concerned citizens to learn and explore solutions to the most pressing public interest issues of our time. If you want to know more, please reach out.

Another passion of mine is connecting and facilitating dialogue across cultures, countries, and communities to help find solutions to urgent sustainable development challenges, such as infrastructure financing and waste management.

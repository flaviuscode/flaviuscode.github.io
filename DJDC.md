# Data Journalism DC

## We bring together data scientists, journalists, and citizens.

### What we do and care about

We began as a way to connect the local participants in the Knight Center's Python for Data Journalists: Analyzing Money in Politics MOOC in June 2017 and continued as a community to get to know more people interested in data journalism, and now worldwide, and learn and produce consequential data journalism that helps identify the scale of an issue of importance to our times or has the potential of influencing policy.

# Data Journalism DC

## We bring together data scientists, journalists, and those interested in telling stories with data 

About Us 

We are a community of people interested in using data to analyze important issues of our times that have the potential of influencing policy.  

We began as a way to connect the local participants in the Knight Center's Python for Data Journalists: Analyzing Money in Politics MOOC in June 2017. 

Organizers: [Kyle Novak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylenovak29/), [Flavius Mihaies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flaviusoxford/), and [Baur Safi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baursafi/).
